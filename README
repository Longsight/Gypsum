Gypsum is a MUD/Telnet client written in Pike. It's built like a
server, but it's a client.

This is *extremely* skeletal at present. It's also hopelessly poor
performing. But it does color, telnet codes, and prompts...

The main routine is in gypsum.pike; it loads all the other modules.
Needs a MUD server to connect to - I use Threshold RPG and Minstrel
Hall myself, but any will do. Currently you have to hack it to pick
servers - see plugins/connect.pike for IPs/ports.
