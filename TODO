* [20111129] Gypsum has now been used in combat.
* Better client-side aliases
* More generally, anything that people expect RosMud to do.
* Spell-checker?
* OOCBox?
* Graphical HP/SP/EP display?? Maybe on the statusbar??
* Boss key (would require support from Pike - Lin/Win/Mac = three separate techniques, all hard)
* Importing of settings from RosMud
* A means of unloading a plugin - would probably mean searching all the mappings for anything whose Object.defined(function_object(x)) is the plugin
* Variant of the above: Clean-up - search for anything with Object.defined() as above but function_object is *not* this plugin

Eventually, drop support for Pike 7.8. This means:
1) Feel free to use new features like ->?
2) Drop COMPAT_SIGNAL and possibly other COMPAT features
3) Provide an additional arg to GTK2.MessageDialog() to bind it to a window
4) (Or when a newer 7.8 build than 805 is released) recode charsheet::noex() to use [sg]et_data()
5) Unconditionally connect to the paste_clipboard signal in window.pike

There are a few places around the code where magic happens. Ideally they should
become less magical... but for now, their documentation here will give them at
least some chance of being found.
* Creating timers (plugins/timer.pike) with names " HP", " SP", and ".EP" will handle them with Threshold RPG semantics.
* Creating a world (plugins/connect.pike) with an IP address of "0.0.0.0" or "::" will put it in passive mode (IPv4 or IPv6).
* Setting persist["wealth/autosplit"] (plugins/wealth.pike) will send, rather than displaying, the split commands.
