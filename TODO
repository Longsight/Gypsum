* More generally, anything that people expect RosMud to do.
  (Easy way to find a whole lot of that is to grep plugins/rmimport.pike for "currently".)
* Spell-checker?
* OOCBox?
* Graphical HP/SP/EP display?? Maybe on the statusbar??
* Cross-platform safety check: copy/paste of huge amounts of text, does it crash? Do I need to protect against it?
* Performance check: is the constant resizing of the display slowing things down?
* Mac support: build a .pkg file that does all the work?? Or at least "get Xquartz and get this pkg".
* Save scrollback as HTML, or some other color-retaining format
* Bug: Sometimes an attempted connection fails with no visible reason, and just hangs.
* Option to suppress display of input?
* Bug: Selection with tabs (sometimes?) can't reach the end of the line.
* Editor plugin needs to support wrap!

Eventually, drop support for Pike 7.8. This means:
1) Feel free to use new features like ->?
2) Drop COMPAT_SIGNAL and possibly other COMPAT features
3) Search the code for "7.8" and see what's commented
4) (Or when a newer 7.8 build than 805 is released) Recode charsheet::noex() to use [sg]et_data()
5) Unconditionally connect to the paste_clipboard signal in window.pike

There are a few places around the code where magic happens. Ideally they should
become less magical... but for now, their documentation here will give them at
least some chance of being found.
* Creating timers (plugins/timer.pike) with names " HP", " SP", and ".EP" will handle them with Threshold RPG semantics.
* Creating a world (plugins/connect.pike) with an IP address of "0.0.0.0" or "::" will put it in passive mode (IPv4 or IPv6).
* Setting persist["wealth/autosplit"] (plugins/wealth.pike) will send, rather than displaying, the split commands.

Vague theories of maybe-this-would-be-nice:
* Boss key (would require support from Pike - Lin/Win/Mac = three separate techniques, all hard)
* 256 color support
