* [20111129] Gypsum has now been used in combat.
* Client-side aliases
* Multi-line paste
* More generally, anything that people expect RosMud to do.
* Spell-checker?
* OOCBox?
* Graphical HP/SP/EP display?? Maybe on the statusbar??
* Boss key (would require support from Pike - Lin/Win/Mac = three separate techniques, all hard)
* Importing of settings from RosMud
* Numeric keypad navigation
* Case insensitive Ctrl-F search
* Passive mode? I was never truly happy with the window-spawning in RM but it might be cleaner now.

Eventually, drop support for Pike 7.8. This means:
1) Feel free to use new features like ->?
2) Drop COMPAT_SIGNAL and possibly other COMPAT features
3) Provide an additional arg to GTK2.MessageDialog() to bind it to a window
4) (Or when a newer 7.8 build than 805 is released) recode charsheet::noex() to use [sg]et_data()
