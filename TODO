* [20111129] Gypsum has now been used in combat.
* Clickable URLs
* Client-side aliases
* Multi-line paste
* /log command to control logging (currently only auto-log works)
* Search facility. May be worth retaining text-only form of line??
* Generic Plugins menu, which any plugin can attach itself to (maybe by inheriting something)

Eventually, drop support for Pike 7.8. This means:
1) Feel free to use new features like ->?
2) Drop COMPAT_SIGNAL and possibly other COMPAT features
3) Provide an additional arg to GTK2.MessageDialog() to bind it to a window
4) (Or when a newer 7.8 build than 805 is released) recode charsheet::noex() to use [sg]et_data()
