* [20111129] Gypsum has now been used in combat.
* Clickable URLs
* Client-side aliases
* Multi-line paste
* /log command to control logging (currently only auto-log works)
* Editor plugin. Designed for live editing rather than off-line work - get a real
editor for that. MUST multiplex perfectly.
* Search facility. May be worth retaining text-only form of line??
