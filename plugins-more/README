Files in this directory are plugins, but will not be loaded automatically.

See ../plugins/README for details on how to write a plugin, and the
'more' plugin for how to load these or other plugins.

Note that a new plugin in this directory will be auto-loaded if and only if
it has a declaration in it, thus:

constant plugin_active_by_default = 1;

It can still be activated and deactivated through the 'more' plugin.
